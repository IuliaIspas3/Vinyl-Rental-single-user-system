The project manages vinyl rentals, allowing the user to borrow, reserve, or return a vinyl, but it also has the delete feature. Java and JavaFX for UI are the technologies applied in the project's development. The system implements multiple design patterns, including State pattern for changing a vinyl status, Observable pattern for simulating the behaviors of two people as two separate threads, and MVVM as a software design pattern.
